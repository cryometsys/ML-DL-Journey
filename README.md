# ML-DL Journey

This repository serves as a **structured collection** of everything I have learned about **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** while following the **BDSet course outline**.

Each day explores specific topics, and every folder typically contains:
- A **PDF** summarizing theoretical knowledge
- A **code file** for hands-on implementation

## Module 2: Machine Learning

- **Day 18:** Support Vector Machines (SVM) + Overfitting & Underfitting  
- **Day 19:** Decision Trees
